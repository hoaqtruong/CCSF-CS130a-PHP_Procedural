<h1>Language</h1>
<p>I start this "interest" 3 years ago when coming to the US. Suddenly my strength becomes my weakness. The day that I made poems, competed in writing, reviewed legal contracts was over, now I hardly be able to express myself in just daily conversation and that was the point when I get into a life-long commitment to improve my language skills.</p>
